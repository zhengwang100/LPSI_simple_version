# LPSI_simple_version
This is a simple version to reproduce the LPSI results in Figure 1 in the original paper "Multiple Source Detection without Knowing the Underlying Propagation Model" [AAAI 17].
The code is written by a Phd student Feng@THU in one night at 04/22/2023.
Feel free to try this simple version.
